How an income jump affects your earnings over a lifetime

I want a calculator that shows applicants how, say, a $30K salary boost, say, in your late 20s, will change the trajectory of your income over a lifetime. So inputs would be age, current salary, new salary, expected annual raise %. Then the output would be a graph showing two lines: pre-Lambda earning projections and post-Lambda earning projections.
